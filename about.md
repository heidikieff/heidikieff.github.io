# Hey there!

## AUBURN - AL

Iâ€™m currently a junior in Graphic Design at Auburn University.

I believe that everything that comes from a designer needs to have intention. I truly enjoy the process and research of each project I get to work on. Whether that be slow or fast paced, I love every second of it. I'm like a sponge, I just can't get enough information. I love how Design allows me to stick my nose in fields I'm not familiar with. As I young designer, it's exciting to me that I have not yet done some of my best work. I have so much to learn and I don't plan on stopping that growing process even when I'm much experienced in this field. Though I take design very seriously, I also feel lucky to have such a fun and ever-changing job! I'm always asking "whats next?"
