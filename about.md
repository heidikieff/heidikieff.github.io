# Hey there!

Everything needs a reason for being the way it is. Don't get me wrong, I swoon over 'aesthetically' pleasing things, but throwing some type and objects together just because it looks good isn't good design. I believe that everything that comes from a designer needs to have intention. Thoughtful research and intentional thinking gets me there. My favorite part of the design process is the initial research and the "ah ha" moment that comes from that. I prefer to work collaboratively, for it lets me see new perspectives and keeps things fresh. I want to push a design as far as it can be pushed. The drive never seems to stop. I'm always asking myself 'what can I make next?' As a young designer, I'm driven because I know I have not yet done my best work yet. That's exciting to me.
