# Hey there!

### AUBURN - AL
{: .lemon}

I am darn passionate about design! I'm currently a junior at Auburn University, studying Graphic Design. I wake up every morning excited to create something. I truly enjoy the process and research of each project I get to work on. Whether that be slow or fast paced, I love every second of it. I'm like a sponge, I can't get enough information. Design allows me to stick my nose in fields I'm not familiar with. As a young designer, it's exciting to me that I have not yet done some of my best work. I have so much to learn and I don't plan on stopping even when I'm much older and experienced in this field. I am looking for an opportunity outside my classwork that throws me from my comfort zone and into the real world. I believe I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job and exceed past my expectations. Though I take design very seriously, I also feel lucky to have such a fun and ever-changing job! I'm always asking "what's next?"
