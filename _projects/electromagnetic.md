  The concept for this project was to choose a word and animate it. I chose Electromagnetic for it is an interesting word, but also would be challenging to animate. I decided to animate each individual letter, and then bring them all together at the end. Each letter is an abstract representation of the word electromagnetic. I was inspired by the Space X launch and came to the word electromagnetic from Nasa's dictionary on their website. My research included watching videos about electromagnetism that inspired the movements of each letter.
