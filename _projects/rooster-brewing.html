  Rooster Brewing Company is a pico-brewery founded by Matthew Cather in his small
  apartment located in Auburn, Alabama. They call themselves a pico-brewer because
  their brewing process is much smaller than your typical micro-brewery. They take
  pride in their home-brews, crafting it to their high standards only to share the
  best brews amongst friends. They believe good beer starts even greater
  conversations. I wanted to design Rooster Brewing Company an identity that feels
  like a small southern grown business. Their first beer labeled "Brown Ale"
  represents their tastes and encourages those great conversations.
