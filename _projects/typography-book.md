# CATCHER IN THE RYE

#### PACKAGING DESIGN

The objective is to choose a theme from the design principles you learned in your foundations and apply this theme to a multi-page book, using concept, type, and grid.Â I wanted to Focus on how typography can be a voice, I experimented with scaled typography and how that portrayed that certain part in the book. Mostly expressing those inner thoughts throughout the book, but having a burst of words when you least expect it.
