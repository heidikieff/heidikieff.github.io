  The objective is to choose a theme from the design principles you learned in
  your foundations and apply this theme to a multi-page book, using concept, type,
  and grid. I wanted to Focus on how typography can be a voice, I experimented
  with scaled typography and how that portrayed that certain part in the book.
  Mostly expressing those inner thoughts throughout the book, but having a burst
  of words when you least expect it.
