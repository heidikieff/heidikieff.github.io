### CATCHER IN THE RYE

#### PACKAGING DESIGN

Objective: Choose a theme from the design principles you learned in your foundations and apply this theme to a multi-page book, using concept, type, and grid.Â 

Concept: Focusing on how typography can be a voice, I experimented with scale and how that portrayed that certain part in the book.
