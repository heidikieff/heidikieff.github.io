Objective: Investigate how type and image can be paired to create rhythm and balance in an album promotional piece. The goal is to create a package design that holds a 45 record, includes the record sleeve + booklet for your chosen musician’s album or concert series.

Concept: Since this event isn’t cheap, I wanted my record design to be intricate, to pose as a grand invitation to this secret show. I wanted my design to really echo the bands behavior: grungy, punk, alternative, and crazy. I’m usually one for delicate typography, and a very structured design, but I wanted to go in a more organic direction with my 45 design. When the buyer looks at my record they shouldn’t feel comfortable, like how you shouldn’t feel comfortable at a Cage the Elephant concert. I like this idea of a handwritten type that resembles a child’s handwriting, even though this band isn’t for children ears. I also want to include these wow factors that surprise the viewer and create that excitement for their invitation to the secret show.
