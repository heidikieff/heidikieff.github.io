description: |
  Cage the Elephant is a high energy alternative rock band. I used the method of
  loose layered type and imagery to convey the bands energy and eclectic sounds.
  They are known for their broad spectrum of music influenced spanning over classic
  rock, funk and alternative favorites. I wanted this record art to be universal
  to the band and their music. Only using black and white to represent their broad
  spectrum of taste. The packaging also acts as an invite to a secret showing +
  art gallery. I portrayed this unique event through a thoughtful distinctive
  design.
