Cage the Elephant is a high energy alternative rock band. I used the method of loose layered type and imagery to convey the bands energy and eclectic sounds. They are known for thier broad spectrum of music influenced spaning over classic rock, funk and alternative favorites. I wanted this record art to be universal to the band. Only using black and white to represent their broad spectrum of taste. The packaging also acts as an invite to a secret showing + art gallery. I portrayed this unique event through a thoughtful distinctive design.
