I used the method of loose layered type and imagery to convey the bands energy and eclectic sounds. The band has a broad spectrum of music influenced from classic rock to alternative favorites. I wanted this record art to be universal to the band. Only using black and white to represent their broad spectrum of taste. The packaging also acts as an invite to a secret showing + art gallery. I portrayed this unique event through a thoughtful distinctive design.
