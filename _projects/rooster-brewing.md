## PACKAGING DESIGN

Rooster Brewing Company is a pico brewery founded by Matthew Cather in his small apartment located in Auburn, Alabama. He calls himself a pico brewer because his brewing process is much smaller than your typical brewery. He took pride in his home brew, crafting it to his high standards, only to share it cold with his friends. He believes good beer starts even greater conversation. I wanted to design them an identity that represented that small southern grown business. Their first beer label "Brown ALe" is representative to his taste that starts those great conversations.
