### ROOSTER BREWING CO.

#### PACKAGING DESIGN

Rooster Brewing Company is a pico-brewery founded by Matthew Cather in his small apartment located in Auburn, Alabama. They calls themselves a pico-brewer because their brewing process is much smaller than your typical micro-brewery. They take pride in thier home-brews, crafting it to thier high standards and think its serverd best cold amongst friends. They believe good beer starts even greater conversations. I wanted to design Rooster Brewing Company an identity that feels like a small southern grown business. Their first beer label "Brown Ale" represents their tastes and encorages those great conversations.
