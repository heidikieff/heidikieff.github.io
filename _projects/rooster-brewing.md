Objective: Branding for a Brewery called “Rooster Brewery.” Their first beet is called Brown Ale and they want the label design to represent their company.

Concept: Sticking to the rooster theme, but taking a modern take on it. Keeping the design very clean and using color to add a sense of excitement.
