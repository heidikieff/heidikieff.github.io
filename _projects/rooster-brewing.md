# ROOSTER BREWING CO.

#### PACKAGING DESIGN

Rooster Brewing Company is a pico-brewery founded by Matthew Cather in his small apartment located in Auburn, Alabama. They call themselves a pico-brewer because their brewing process is much smaller than your typical micro-brewery. They take pride in their home-brews, crafting it to their high standards only to share the best brews amongst friends. They believe good beer starts even greater conversations. I wanted to design Rooster Brewing Company an identity that feels like a small southern grown business. Their first beer labeled "Brown Ale" represents their tastes and encourages those great conversations.
