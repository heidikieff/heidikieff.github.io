# HOUSE OF CARDS - MODULA

## PACKAGING DESIGN

Modula was one of the first font families designed on the new macintosh. Modula is firmly grounded in the idea of that these forms of computer fonts must result as an integral part of the digital process, not in spite of it. The computer was very crude when it came to producing subtle curves. I wanted my House of Cards to tell that story. Showing each letterform and pairing it with a composition that represented that new age of technology.
