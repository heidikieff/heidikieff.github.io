# HOUSE OF CARDS - MODULA

#### PACKAGING DESIGN

Modula was the first high resolution font family designed on the new Apple Macintosh 512K. The font embraces it's digital design process. It was designed to complement the computers ability to produce perfect geometric elements unlike existing analog fonts, who produced hideous emulations of the original because of the limitations of bitmap fonts. I wanted my House of Cards to tell that story. Showing each letterform and pairing it with a composition that represented that new age of technology.
