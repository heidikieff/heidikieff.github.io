# HOUSE OF CARDS - MODULA
## PACKAGING DESIGN
Objective: Dive into a selected Emigre type face learning its origin and the different parts of a letterform to form a deck of cards. Puzzler also must be used in each card design.

Concept: To create a focus on the font Modula created by emigre. Modula was one of the first type face created on the new macintosh. I wanted to represent those qualities of the type
 face on the cards. Showing each part of the letterform and mixing it with a design that represented that new age of technology.
