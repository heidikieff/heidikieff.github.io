description: |
  When designing a poster for the 60th anniversary of the Birmingham Zoo, I wanted
  to reflect on how far they had excelled over the years. By representing stepping
  into the future and using a modernized poster for their anniversary, I created
  a concept that would stop pedestrians in their paths. The poster uses bright
  colors and simplistic illustration to pull the viewers curiosity in for a greater
  understanding. The Mandrill isn't the friendliest of monkeys and I didn't
  want to hide that in my design.
