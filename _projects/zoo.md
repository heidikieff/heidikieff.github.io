When designing a poster for the 60th anniversary of the Birmingham Zoo, I wanted to reflect on how far they had come over the years. Representing stepping into the future and using a modernized poster for their anniversary. I created a concept that would stop pedestrians in their paths. The poster uses bright colors and simplistic illustration to pull the viewers curiosity in for a greater understanding. The Mandrill isn't the friendliest of monkeys and I didn't want to hide that in me design.
