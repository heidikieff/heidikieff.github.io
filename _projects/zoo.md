# BIRMINGHAM 60TH ANNIVERSARY ZOO POSTER

#### PACKAGING DESIGN

When designing a poster for the 60th anniversary of the Birmingham Zoo, I wanted to reflect on how far they had excelled over the years. By representing stepping into the future and using a modernized poster for their anniversary, I created a concept that would stop pedestrians in their paths. The poster uses bright colors and simplistic illustration to pull the viewers curiosity in for a greater understanding. The Mandrill isn't the friendliest of monkeys and I didn't want to hide that in my design.
